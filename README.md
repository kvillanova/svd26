# SVD26

You can test this website at http://test.svd.cc/. The database is all set there and you could manipulate as you wish.

The system has been build from the ground up by Kevin Villanova. All the rights are reserved and you can't clone this system without the author's proper consent.

## About the project
This is a web-based game that relies on social strategy, inspired by the reality TV show Survivor, from CBS, on the United States. It's a free of charge competition with purposes of entretainment, to reunite friends and meet people from all over Brazil, and sometimes even from outside the borders. This game uses social media for communication and engagement, and this system for the players to perform challenges and other internal activities inside the game.

You can see the official Wiki of the project at https://svd.cc. (All the wiki contents will be in Brazilian Portuguese, the official language of the project).

### /painel/
This is the administration area. Only the moderators of the game can have access. (For testing purposes, it's not locked this time). Here we have all the players' keys (their unique id to access the system), the challenges that are installed, the idols and clues that are found, and the others services (twists) that are used by the game.

For testing purposes you can pick any key from this area to use in the other areas, like challenges, the Camp, and voting.

TIP: You can reset a key by clicking the green button (ACTIVE), making it red (INACTIVE), and then turning it on again. This would make that key no longer tied to your device.

### /camp/
In the Camp you can search for the hidden immunity idol on the map. You can look for up to 10 coordinates every 8 hours. But every square on the map you visit would show your last locations for an additional 30 minutos until the cycle and the penalty time expires.

You can also see the clues you find, you happen to found any on the map on the third menu icon.

### /ct/
It's the tribal council, where you select somebody to be voted out of the game. Terrible place to be.

### /finalquiz/
One of the challenges of the 26th season. It is a Quiz about the history of the game. You have to answer every question correctly to finish this challenge. But you do not know you have an incorrect answer until you pass the last question. If there is one mistake, you would go back to the first question, without knowing how many and which questions were incorrect.

### /finalsprint/
It's played like a marathon! We have a list of past challenges that you need to complete in a row, so that is usually the last challenge of the season. Every minichallenge has to be completed in order to finish this assignment.
